I&rsquo;m here to argue this has been a very bad development. Ironically, this means that, in some ways, games in the past had better graphics than today&rsquo;s games.</p><p>The problem with realistic graphics is that it gives the player an impractical number of shapes to work with. Instead, any benefit of such graphics lies with the marketing of such games, which I think is the reason why games with complicated graphics are still around, despite the enormous development costs.</p><p>When I was young, I noticed how rapidly graphics were improving in the 1990s and wondered how awesome video games would be in the future, like in the year 2015. Obviously, we&rsquo;d have flying cars and hoverboards, but what would video games look like?</p><p>I could have never imagined the improvement in technology would have such a negative effect on games. Now, we are years beyond even 2015, and video games are very much <em>not</em> awesome.</p><p>But how could it be that realistic graphics are problematic? I mean&mldr; real-life is realistic, ain&rsquo;t it? Real-life obviously presents you with realistic graphics, showing you a great number of shapes, and it seems to not present any difficulty. The short answer is, realistic graphics are difficult because games have rules that are unlike rules in real-life, which makes you interpret game graphics very differently. This interpretation process is part of the gameplay experience. Further, realistic imagery contains irrelevant information, making it harder to discern relevant information within the game. Past hardware limitations are practically gone now, but these limitations were actually helpful to the experience, in part because they made graphics more abstract.</p><h1 id=the-rules-of-the-game>The Rules of the Game</h1><p>If I were to see a mundane thing such as a coffee mug in real life, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask myself how I interact with that object; it is what it is. Yet, if I were to see a coffee mug in a first-person shooter, I might immediately be dealing with dozens of questions. Can I pick it up and drink from it? If so, would it replenish my health, or energy? Can I grab it and throw it like a weapon? If so, how much damage would it do? What would happen if I shoot the mug? Needless to say, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask such questions in real-life.</p><p>The summary of these questions would be: What is the meaning of this thing? In real-life, the meaning of things is fixed, but not so in a game. A thing in a game is an element, and games have rules about their elements. This fact has major implications for game design.</p><p>When looking at the screen, players try to discern gameplay elements from the graphics. The meaning of these elements is gradually explored over time. It could be useful to give this a name. We can call this process <em>Discernment of Elements and Exploration of Meaning</em>, or DEEM.</p><p>DEEM is arguably a fundamental part of gameplay. Games are all about interactivity, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to be mashing buttons the entire time. You could be looking at the screen while <em>not</em> pushing any buttons and still be highly preoccupied.</p><h1 id=moving-pictures>Moving Pictures</h1><p>Modern games are distinguished from past games by the immense detail of graphics and real-time rendering of lighting. (If older games had highly detailed graphics and fancy lighting, then it wasn&rsquo;t rendered in real-time. And therein lies the rub.)</p><p>Because shapes within objects may be meaningful, elements are more about shapes than objects. If an object lacks abstraction, it may contain a multitude of shapes, depending on how it is rendered. The lack of abstraction impedes the discernment of elements by the sheer number of shapes. Another reason for difficulty in discerning elements is that real-time lighting may cause elements to appear to blend together<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t happen in the absence of such lighting.</p><p>If the player is given enough time to discern elements (as with point-and-click adventure games) these things may not necessarily be problematic. But there&rsquo;s never enough time in action games, because the game&rsquo;s mechanics are responsible for rapid changes in graphics (such as moving the camera in a first-person shooter). This creates a mismatch between the speed by which graphics change and the rate at which the player is able to discern elements. Before the player is able to understand the graphics, things will have already changed. If these action mechanics are fundamental to the game, it would mean the game is perpetually out of step with the player&rsquo;s understanding.</p><p>So when graphics change, elements change. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that <em>meaning can be subject to change</em>. For example, if a player picks up a power-up for a weapon, the weapon may change appearance, signifying that the meaning of the weapon has changed. (The weapon has become more powerful.) Being on the look-out for meaningful change is part of gameplay.</p><p>Real-time lighting and other real-time graphical effects disrupt the exploration of meaning by causing changes in appearance of elements <em>that have not changed in meaning.</em> The player will learn to recognize that these visual changes are meaningless to gameplay (false positives). But because these advanced effects are rendered in real-time, they are repeated over and over, creating an endless series of false positives. The player is then burdened with the task of cutting through this noise and continuously ignore<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> much of the graphics, while simultaneously being tasked to keep an eye on changes that do matter.</p><p>What is the total effect of all these things on the user experience? It&rsquo;s hard to fully ascertain. But from my own experience, and my observations of gamers, modern graphics make playing games feel like a terrible chore.</p><h1 id=supply-and-demand>Supply and Demand?</h1><p>If video games with simpler graphics are more usable and easier to play, why do games with complicated graphics persist? I think the reason is less about what people prefer, and more about what people choose to buy. Even if we assume people prefer games with graphics that are easy to work with, they may still be inclined to buy games with complicated graphics. Complicated graphics get in the way during play, but likely play an important role in the consumer&rsquo;s behavior when choosing to buy a game.</p><p>I remember reading something about how development costs of modern games have skyrocketed due to &lsquo;increased consumer expectations&rsquo;, or some such, meaning that there&rsquo;s demand for games with highly advanced graphics. I don&rsquo;t think there is such a demand. When people want to play a game, they have to make choices, and there are things that influence how people make choices.</p><p>One possible explanation for this &lsquo;demand&rsquo; for highly detailed graphics goes like this. People want to buy products that are well-made, and try to look for signs of a well-made product. If games with highly detailed and technically advanced graphics give the impression that great effort went into the product, it could give the impression that the product is well-made. The graphics are then perceived as a sign that the product is well-made, leading consumers to decide to buy the product. So rather than there being a demand for games with advanced graphics, there is instead a demand for well-made games. That means advanced graphics are there just to get people&rsquo;s attention, which makes it a form of marketing.</p><p>Whenever I see some report of how much a certain game cost to be made, and mentions figures, let&rsquo;s say, $100 million development and $50 million marketing, then I think to myself, a major chunk of that development figure is secretly part of the marketing figure. The marketing aspects were pushed into product development.</p><h1 id=marketing>Marketing</h1><p>There was a time when I didn&rsquo;t concern myself with the marketing aspect. A designer should <em>focus on the design</em>, I thought. The mere thought of polluting the design process with marketing concerns was upsetting to me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve done a complete reversal on this matter. As a designer, you <em>work</em> on the design but <em>focus</em> on the user. In the early stage of development, users are hypothetical, but the day will come when the design is finished, and then, users will have to be real. Design must make contact with people. Marketing is all about making contact.</p><p>But there are those, who dream of not just making contact with <em>some</em> users, but rather <em>all</em> of the users. Should they be in charge of development, they may be tempted to throw the product under the bus to achieve this dream.</p><p>Which seems to be what&rsquo;s happening with modern games. Highly detailed graphics are there for the sake of marketing; helping sales but harming the experience. But on the other hand, the marketing aspect can&rsquo;t be ignored. Games should be usable, but they must also make contact. Advancement in technology has brought with it a major and unexpected challenge.</p><p>This challenge lies with marketing, not design. If you try to make a game with simple graphics, it may not get as much attention as a game with complicated graphics. Getting <em>as much</em> attention may not sound like a big deal, but this is a competitive space. If consumers choose to buy <em>their</em> game, they may not buy <em>your</em> game. How do you get people to be <em>as hyped</em> for a game with simple graphics as a game with complex graphics? A game with simple graphics today may give the impression of not being particularly ambitious. But that may not be the case! It could in fact be so much more ambitious than those games with ultra-realistic graphics. But how do you convince people of that? How do you get them to be excited?</p><p>It&rsquo;s a difficult problem. Whatever the solution is, it will have to be creative.</p><h1 id=back-to-looking-foward-to-the-future>Back To Looking Foward To The Future</h1><p>DEEM is my answer to the question of why it seems like older games were just plain better. I hope this blog post has made clear that nostalgia (or <em>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re just getting older&rdquo;</em>) has absolutely nothing to do with.</p><p>Years ago, I played the original Doom (1993) for the first time as I didn&rsquo;t get to play it around the time it was released. When I played it, I was only mildly amused.</p><p>But then I noticed something. Somehow, it was very strangely easy to play. Whenever I play a modern game, it feels like an like overwhelming chore to get into. When I played Doom for the first time, it felt like I could instantly hit the ground running.</p><p>It took a while to make sense of this experience. At first, I thought perhaps the controls were what made it easier. Now I realize it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than that.</p><p>How wonderful would it be when we would finally have to the power to render ultra-realistic worlds in real-time, forever unshackling game developers of the limitations of hardware&mldr; Not so wonderful, it turns out!</p><p>Still, I&rsquo;m optimistic today&rsquo;s problems can be solved. And should they be solved, who knows what games will look like then?</p><p>In the end, you can never quite know what the future will bring.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Elements can blend together for other reasons, like a particular style of graphics, for example <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fall%20Guys>Fall Guys</a> where seemingly everything on the screen has the same soft and colorful look.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>When I browsed <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/>Twitch</a> for games with advanced graphics, I took a look at Horizon Forbidden West and noticed quite a few instances of UI prompts during gameplay.
