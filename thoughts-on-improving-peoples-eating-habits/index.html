And the numbers don&rsquo;t lie.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>People just keep getting fatter.</p><p>Why is this happening? How can this trend be reversed?</p><p>Whenever this topic comes up, there is talk about how our ancestors lived and how they ate, and I have to admit, it is something I really enjoy thinking about.</p><p>Everyday we have to make choices about what to eat, but this is radically different to how our ancestors lived. They weren&rsquo;t faced with the sheer amount of choice we have. They didn&rsquo;t have to contend with that level of freedom.</p><p>So I came up with this: surrender that freedom by hiring someone to make choices for you. You let that person know what you like to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and then that person will make healthy choices for you, freeing you of the burden of choice.</p><p>The problem with this idea is that you need to be wealthy enough to hire someone like that. This is probably unafforable for most people. I wanted to come up with something that would work for the average person.</p><p>What I have in mind is not a temporary diet, but rather a permanent change in eating behavior. It means it wouldn&rsquo;t stop until a person is healthier. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a new way of eating. <em>For life.</em> That&rsquo;s why it has to be affordable.</p><p>Even though I started thinking about this because people are getting fatter, it could work for other groups of people, such as people who struggle to gain or maintain weight, or those who are already healthy and would like to be healthier.</p><h1 id=benevolent-dictator-for-life>Benevolent Dictator For Life</h1><p>Now I&rsquo;ve come up with a more refined version of the idea, and I&rsquo;m thinking it could work. It goes like this: you surrender freedom to choose what to eat but only for a particular time of day. Let&rsquo;s say dinner. To spread out the cost of hiring someone to make choices for you, you do it together with people who also wish to defer those choices to someone else. This means you&rsquo;ll have to eat together as a group.</p><p>Doing this everyday may still be too expensive, but maybe it could be done only on workdays, i.e. five days a week.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say a group agrees with such an arrangement. Would this lead to an improvement in health for the individuals of that group?</p><p>I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone, but very often when I think about what I&rsquo;m going to have for dinner, I sometimes end up making an unhealthy choice due to personal circumstances. Even though I am thin and healthy, I have noticed that there are periods in my life where it&rsquo;s hard to maintain healthy eating habits.</p><p>If I want to eat healthy, I have to make healthy choices. But there are things that influence my choices. If I end up making a choice that is unhealthy, it&rsquo;s not because I insist, no matter what, on eating that particular dish. It&rsquo;s more like I was pulled in that direction due to certain factors, like stress.</p><p>The idea of the arrangement is that the participants are being nudged in the right direction by this new circumstance, a circumstance where you don&rsquo;t have to choose. The person who will be making the choices instead is someone who understands nutrition and also knows what the participants like to eat.</p><p>If the arrangement is only for dinner, it means the participants will continue to have to make their own choices for what they&rsquo;ll eat at other times of the day. Yet it&rsquo;s possible that because of the experience of the arrangement, they may be positively influenced at those other times, leading them to make healthier choices on their own.</p><h1 id=gezelligheid->&lsquo;Gezelligheid&rsquo; ?</h1><p>My proposal requires participants to eat as a group. Personally, I always eat alone, because I&rsquo;ve never seen the need to eat together with people. It just so happens that I also struggle with loneliness, and I realize I&rsquo;m not exactly alone in that.</p><p>The arrangement I&rsquo;ve described could very well offer me a good reason to stop eating alone. In the optimistic scenario, participants would feel less lonely as a result, and positive effects would go beyond those that would be attributed to an improved diet.</p><p>If this turns out to be an enjoyable social event, it&rsquo;s possible that this could provide enough motivation for someone to do the necessary work for free. So instead of hiring someone to make arrangements and make choices for the group, the work could be done by a volunteer. That could be the final piece to the puzzle to make everything feasible from a cost perspective.</p><h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><ul><li><p>More problematic than the abundance of food is the abundance of choice</p></li><li><p>People struggle to make healthy choices</p></li><li><p>Deferring choice to someone else could lead to healthier choices</p></li><li><p>If employing someone to make those choices, a group is required to spread the cost and make it affordable</p></li><li><p>If the arrangement serves as a pleasant social event, it could motivate people to volunteer to do the necessary work, reducing cost</p></li><li><p>It could motivate people to attend a social event they may not otherwise attend, potentially improving health further</p></li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight>https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2023 Ben Hosseinzahi</footer></body></html>
